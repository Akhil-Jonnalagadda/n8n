# 📘 Introduction to n8n

n8n (pronounced as “n-eight-n”) is an **open-source workflow automation tool**. The name stands for **“nodemation”**, which comes from combining “node” and “automation.” Think of it like a toolbox where you can connect different apps, databases, and APIs together without needing to write long pieces of code.

For example:

* Imagine you get new customer data in Google Sheets.
* You want that data to also go into your CRM (like HubSpot or Salesforce) and notify your Slack channel.
* Normally, you’d need to write code or do manual work.
* With n8n, you can drag-and-drop nodes (blocks) for Google Sheets, HubSpot, and Slack, then connect them in a simple flow.
* Once you press “execute,” n8n does the rest automatically.

In short:

* **Zapier-like**, but **open-source** and much more customizable.
* Can run in the **cloud** or **self-hosted** (your own server).
* Supports **600+ integrations** (and growing).
* Built on **Node.js**, so it’s lightweight and developer-friendly.

n8n is often described as:

* **Low-code automation** → For people who don’t want to code everything.
* **Full flexibility** → For developers who *do* want to customize using JavaScript, functions, or API calls.

👉 Think of it as a bridge between “no-code tools” (like Zapier) and “full custom coding.”

# 📘 History & Evolution of n8n

n8n was created by **Jan Oberhauser** in **2019**. He wanted to solve a big problem:

* Most automation tools (like Zapier or Integromat/Make) were **closed-source** and limited.
* If you wanted extra flexibility (like custom logic, private hosting, or more complex integrations), you had to pay a lot or couldn’t do it at all.
* Companies needed automation that could run **on their own servers**, keeping data private and secure.

So, Jan built **n8n as open-source**, where anyone could:

1. **Self-host** it on their machine, server, or cloud.
2. **Extend it** by writing custom nodes and functions.
3. **Collaborate with community** – people could build and share integrations together.

### Timeline of Growth

* **2019** → First version launched on GitHub. Quickly gained attention from developers because it was free, open-source, and flexible.
* **2020** → Startup “n8n GmbH” was founded in Berlin, Germany. Got early funding to keep building the project.
* **2021** → Grew a big community on GitHub and Discord. Added integrations for popular tools like Slack, Gmail, AWS, GitHub, PostgreSQL, etc.
* **2022** → Introduced **n8n Cloud** → a hosted version for people who didn’t want to manage servers themselves.
* **2023** → Reached over **30,000 GitHub stars** 🚀 and became one of the fastest-growing open-source automation projects.
* **2024+** → Continued to expand integrations (600+). Focused on making workflows easier for **business users** while keeping power for **developers**.

### Why it became popular

* **Open-source freedom** → Unlike Zapier, you’re not locked into one platform.
* **Community-driven** → Developers worldwide create and share new nodes.
* **Affordable** → Free to self-host, only pay for cloud/enterprise options if you want.
* **Flexibility** → You can add conditions, loops, error handling, and even write custom code.

👉 Today, n8n is widely used by **startups, freelancers, and enterprises** to automate everything from **marketing campaigns** to **data pipelines** to **DevOps alerts**.

# 📘 Core Concepts of n8n

To understand n8n fully, you need to know its **core building blocks**. Don’t worry — it’s simple once you break it down:

---

### 1. **Nodes** 🟩

* A **node** is a block in n8n that does one specific job.
* Example:

  * A **Gmail node** sends or reads emails.
  * A **Slack node** posts messages.
  * A **MySQL node** runs database queries.
* You connect nodes together to create a chain (like Lego pieces).

---

### 2. **Workflows** 🔄

* A **workflow** is a group of connected nodes that achieve something.
* Example workflow:

  * Start when a new row is added to Google Sheets.
  * Send that row’s data to HubSpot CRM.
  * Notify the sales team in Slack.
* Each workflow can have 2 nodes or 200+ nodes — depends on your needs.

---

### 3. **Triggers** ⚡

* A **trigger node** is what starts the workflow.
* Types of triggers:

  * **Time-based** → e.g., run every day at 9 AM.
  * **Event-based** → e.g., when you get a new email, or a webhook is called.
  * **Manual** → you press the “execute” button.

---

### 4. **Executions** ▶️

* Each time a workflow runs, it’s called an **execution**.
* n8n lets you see a **detailed execution log**: which node ran, what data was passed, and where errors happened.
* This makes debugging very easy.

---

### 5. **Credentials** 🔑

* To connect with external services (like Google, AWS, GitHub), you store your **credentials** in n8n.
* n8n keeps them secure and re-uses them across workflows.

---

### 6. **Expressions & Functions** 🧑‍💻

* If you want more flexibility, you can use **expressions** (small pieces of code) inside a node.
* Example: `{{ $json.email }}` → this will grab the “email” field from incoming data.
* You can also write **JavaScript functions** for custom logic.

---

👉 So, in simple words:

* **Nodes = tasks**
* **Workflows = a group of tasks**
* **Triggers = what starts the tasks**
* **Executions = when tasks run**

---

✅ With these basics, you can now picture how n8n actually works.

---

Awesome 🙌 Let’s go deeper now. Here’s **Page 4** of your README draft.

---

# 📘  How n8n Works Internally

Now that we know what nodes, workflows, and triggers are, let’s see how n8n works **under the hood**. Don’t worry — we’ll keep it simple.

---

### 1. **Built on Node.js** 🟨

* n8n is written in **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime).
* This makes it lightweight, fast, and easy to run anywhere (Windows, Mac, Linux, Docker, or cloud).

---

### 2. **Workflow Engine** ⚙️

* The **engine** is the “brain” of n8n.
* It takes your workflow (the chain of nodes) and runs them step by step.
* Each node receives data → processes it → passes it to the next node.

Example:

1. A trigger node (say, Gmail) gets new email data.
2. That data flows into a **Filter node** (to check conditions).
3. If it passes, it goes into a **Slack node** (to send a message).

---

### 3. **Database** 🗄️

* n8n needs a small database to store:

  * Your workflows
  * Your credentials
  * Your execution history (logs)
* By default, it uses **SQLite** (built-in, good for small projects).
* For bigger projects, you can use **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.

---

### 4. **Execution Modes** ▶️

* **Manual Execution** → when you press “Execute Workflow” in the editor.
* **Automatic Execution** → when a trigger node fires.
* **Queued Execution** → when many workflows run at the same time, n8n puts them in a queue so your system doesn’t crash.

---

### 5. **Editor UI** 🎨

* The n8n **editor** is the visual part you see in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5678`).
* You drag nodes, connect them, and build workflows visually.
* This UI talks to the backend engine using an API.

---

### 6. **Extensibility** 🔌

* Developers can create **custom nodes** with JavaScript/TypeScript.
* You can even call external APIs directly using the **HTTP Request node**.

---

👉 So, to summarize:

* **Node.js app** → runs the workflow engine.
* **Database** → stores workflows & credentials.
* **Editor UI** → drag & drop workflows visually.
* **Execution logs** → show what happened step by step.

That’s the secret sauce: a mix of simplicity for beginners, but deep flexibility for developers.

---

Great 👍 Let’s continue. Here’s **Page 5** for your GitHub README.

Perfect 🚀 Let’s dive into the more powerful side of n8n. Here’s **Page 8** for your README draft.

---

#  Advanced Features of n8n

So far, we’ve seen the basics. But n8n also comes with **advanced features** that make it much more powerful than simple “if-this-then-that” tools.

---

### 1. **Conditional Logic (If/Else)** 🔀

* Use the **IF node** to add logic:

  * Example: If `order_amount > 100`, send a VIP email. Else, send a normal email.
* This allows workflows to make decisions like code would.

---

### 2. **Loops** 🔁

* Sometimes you need to process many items (like a list of users).
* The **Split In Batches node** or **Looping** lets you handle them one by one.
* Example: Go through 500 emails and send personalized messages.

---

### 3. **Error Handling** ⚠️

* Workflows don’t always run perfectly. APIs can fail or data can be missing.
* n8n lets you handle errors:

  * Retry automatically.
  * Send an alert if something breaks.
  * Skip failed items and continue.

---

### 4. **Webhooks** 🌐

* A **Webhook node** lets external apps send data into n8n in real time.
* Example: A form on your website sends data directly into n8n → then it goes to your CRM, Slack, and email.
* This is powerful for real-time automation.

---

### 5. **Code Nodes (Function & Function Item)** 💻

* You can write custom **JavaScript** inside workflows.
* Example: Format dates, calculate numbers, or merge objects.
* This makes n8n half “no-code” and half “pro-code.”

---

### 6. **Expressions Everywhere** ✨

* Almost every field in n8n can use expressions (`{{ }}`).
* Example:

  * Slack message: `New order from {{$json["customerName"]}}`
  * Email subject: `Invoice #{{$json["invoiceId"]}}`
* This keeps data dynamic.

---

### 7. **Multiple Branches** 🌳

* You can connect one node to many others.
* Example:

  * When a new user signs up →

    * Branch 1: Send them a welcome email.
    * Branch 2: Add them to CRM.
    * Branch 3: Notify the sales team.

---

👉 With these advanced features, you can build **complex automations** that are close to real programming, but still visual.
